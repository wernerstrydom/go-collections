# Collections

## Overview 

This repository contains a set of collections for the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/).
It's inspired by [.NET Collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic). As I worked 
in Go, I missed the collections I used to use in .NET. So I decided to create this repository to help me and others to 
use collections in Go.
